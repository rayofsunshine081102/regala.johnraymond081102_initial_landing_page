        My other interests to learn about are the following: First, learning more about Physics and Astronomy <sup> 2 </sup>. I
        It is fascinating to me since childhood to learn more about my world, the universe, and all the underlying theories of existence <sup> 3 </sup>. 
        Learning more about this subject humbles me since there are still things that I know and need to learn <sup> 4 </sup>. 
        Second, learning more about personal finance and/or money in general. Learning about money and personal finance is important because it helps you take control         of your financial future, achieve financial stability, and reach your financial goals <sup> 5 </sup>. 
        This knowledge can also help you make informed decisions about spending, saving, investing, and managing debt <sup> 6 </sup>. 
        By developing good financial habits and understanding the basics of finance, you can improve your quality of life and
        secure a brighter financial future <sup>  7 </sup>. 
        As of now I'm starting to save at least 5-10% of my daily allowance in a week <sup> 8 </sup>. 
        Furthermore, I started to bring home cooked food to school to reduce my food expenses <sup> 9</sup>. 
        Lastly, I have learned to spend my money on assets not on liabilities<sup> 10 </sup>. </p>
